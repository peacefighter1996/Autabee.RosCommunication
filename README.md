# Autabee.Roscommunicator
This repository contains a collection of objects to make it easier/possible to communicate with ROS from a .NET application. More specifically a Blazor WASM. This is partly to support UI development for the TU-Delft course `RO47007 Multidisciplinary Project 2023/24` for controlling the Mirte Master project. More information about Mirth can be found [here](https://www.mirte.org), Master version is not yet released outside of the course.

Basis of this project is from the Opc Scout project, which is a project that is used to communicate with OPC-UA servers. This project is also developed by the same group and can be found [here](https://github.com/Autabee/Autabee.OpcCommunication)

> :warning: **Warning** 
> This project is still in development and is not yet ready for production use. However, support and pull requests are welcome.

## Current capabilities and features

- Able to talk with topics and services on a ROS bridge
- Able to extract data from the RosMaster 
  - Topics
  - Services
  - Nodes
  - Parameters [coming soon]
- Some initial UI design
- Translation from XMLRPC to C# objects for easier data handling
- Exposed Api With swagger for easy testing and development.
- But also allows other applications to communicate with the ROS bridge / Ros master through the API.

## Projects
The solution contains the following projects:

- **Autabee.Communication.RosClient**: This project contains helper classes and object to communicate with ROS.
- **Autabee.RosScout.BlazorWASM**: This project contains a Blazor WASM application that can be used to control a ROS robot.
- **Autabee.RosScout.BlazorWASM.Server**: This project contains the server side of the Blazor WASM application.

## Libraries
The following libraries are used in this project:

- **[RosSharp](https://github.com/Autabee/ros-sharp)**: Originally developed by Siemens, this library is used to communicate with ROS. However, due to stalled development and specific requirements, this library is forked and modified to support specific needs of this project. (Update follows soon)

## To Do

- [ ] Documentation for the project. Mostly in therms of architecture and how to use different parts of the project.
- [ ] Get Subscription working through SignalR, currently the Web App connects directly to the ROS bridge, but this should not be the case as it comes with remote deployment issues when deployed in an inaccessible network. (Challenging)
- [ ] Develop Controls for the Web App to control the robot
  - [ ] Move control 
  - [ ] Ultra Sonic Sensor feed
  - [ ] Camera feed (Challenging)
  - [ ] Arm/Gripper control
  - [ ] Map view (Challenging)
- [ ] Develop ID Node to be launched on robot for dynamic page acquisition. So that the Web App can be used for any robot. 
- [ ] Retrieve specifics about active services for dynamic control creation and validation of system
- [ ] Authentication and Authorization for the Web API (Challenging)
